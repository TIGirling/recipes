Ingredients:
- 2tsp sunflower oil
- 1 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed
- 1 medium leek, trimmed and finely sliced
- 100ml white wine
- 150ml water
- 1 chicken stock cube
- 1kg whole cooked chicken
- 100g sliced smoked ham
- 2tbsp plain flour
- 300g half fat creme fraiche
- freshly ground black pepper

Pastry
- 3 sheets filo pastry (approx 40x30cm each)
- 2 tsp sunflower oil

Directions:
1. Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a low heat and add the onion and crushed garlic.
   Fry gently for 5 minutes until the onion is softened, but not coloured, stirring occasionally. Add
   the leek and cook for 1 minute more, stirring constantly.
   
2. Pour over the white wine and 100ml of the water. Dissolve the stock cube in the pan by squishing it
   with a wooden spoon. Keep simmering on a high heat and stir constantly until the liquid has reduced
   by about half, then remove the pan from the heat.
   
3. Strip off the skin from the chicken and tear the meat off the bones and into bite sized pieces.
   Place them in a large bowl. Cut the ham into strips about 1.5cm wide and add them to the bowl. 
   Sprinkle the flour on top and toss lightly together.
   
4. Add the onion and stock mixture, the rest of the water and the creme fraiche. Season with lots of 
   freshly ground black pepper and stir all the ingredients together until just combined. Spoon into 
   a 1.5 litre pie dish. Preheat oven to 200 degrees Centigrade.
   
5. Pile the filo sheets onto a work surface, one on top of the other, and divide into 9 rectangles,
   cutting through all the layers. Put the oil into a small bowl.
   
6. One at a time, brush each pastry rectangle lightly with a little oil and very loosely scrunch it up.
   You'll need to just dip the tip of the pasty brush in the oil to make sure the oil lasts for all of 
   the pastry. Place the scrunched-up filo on top of the filling, putting the pieces close together 
   until the surface of the pie is completely covered.
   
7. Bake the pie for 30-35 minutes or until the pastry is crisp and golden brown and the filling bubbling.
   Serve with some green veg.
